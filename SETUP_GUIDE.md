- Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
- Check you haven't exceeded rate limits (wait 5 minutes)
- Make sure you're authenticated (logged in)

### "Failed to connect to database"

**Solution**:
- Check your Supabase project is running (not paused)

- Check your internet connection

### Session immediately expires

**Solution**:
- Make sure `SESSION_SECRET` is at least 32 characters
- Clear your browser cookies
